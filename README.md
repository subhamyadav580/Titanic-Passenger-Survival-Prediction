# Titanic-Passenger-Survival-Prediction

One of the famous stories is Titanic a luxury steamship that sank into the deep blue ocean in 1912.
Leading to the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. But it seems some groups of
people were more likely to survive than others.
In this project, we will use a machine learning technique in order to analyze and build a predictive
model to find the factors and predict passenger who is to survive or die from this catastrophe.
